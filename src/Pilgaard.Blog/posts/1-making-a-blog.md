# Making a blog with C# - Part 1

## Planning & pretext

I've been wanting to try out Blazor for a while now, so I decided 
on making a blog with it, so I could share my experienes along the way.

To share as much of the experience as possible, I'm going to make the blog available as
soon as it's functional - Meaning there's a good chance it's rough on the eyes at first. Sorry :D

I'll be improving on the blog gradually and making posts about it along the way. 

## The plan

1. Pick tools & hosting
2. Blog website MVP - *probably just a page with text*
3. Publish website
4. Setup git & CI/CD
5. Add links to GitHub, Twitter, LinkedIn etc
6. Improve appearance of the website
7. A system that allows me to make and publish new blog posts directly on the website
8. Get a custom domain
9. Search Engine Optimizations (SEO)
10. Allow people to subscribe to get notifications about new posts
11. ???

Let's see how far that plan takes us! :D
