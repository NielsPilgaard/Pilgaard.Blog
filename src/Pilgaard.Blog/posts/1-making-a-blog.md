<h1 id="making-a-blog-part-1">Making a blog with C# - Part 1</h1>

## Planning

I've been wanting to try out Blazor for a while now, so I decided
on making a blog with it, so I could share my experienes along the way.

To share as much of the experience as possible, I'm going to make the blog available as
soon as it's functional - Meaning there's a good chance it's rough on the eyes at first. Sorry :D

I'll be improving on the blog gradually and making posts about it along the way.

## The plan

1. Pick tools & hosting
2. Blog website MVP - _probably just a page with text_
3. Publish website
4. Add links to GitHub, Twitter, LinkedIn etc
5. Improve appearance of the website
6. A system that allows me to make and publish new blog posts directly on the website
7. A comment section for blog posts
8. Search Engine Optimizations (SEO)
9. Allow people to subscribe to get notifications about new posts
10. ???

Let's see how far that plan takes us! :D
