<MudText Typo="Typo.body1">
    I've been wanting to try out Blazor for a while now, so I decided
    on making a blog with it, so I could share my experienes along the way.
</MudText>
<MudText Typo="Typo.body1">
    To share as much of the experience as possible, I'm going to make the blog available as
    soon as it's functional - Meaning there's a good chance it's rough on the eyes at first. Sorry :D
</MudText>
<MudText Typo="Typo.body1">
    I'll be improving on the blog gradually and making posts about it along the way.
