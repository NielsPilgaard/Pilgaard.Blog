### Making a blog with C# - Part 1
# Planning
I've been wanting to try out Blazor for a while now, so I decided
on making a blog with it, so I could share my experiences along the way.

To share as much of the experience as possible, I'm going to make the blog available as
soon as it's functional - Meaning there's a good chance it's rough on the eyes at first. Sorry 😄

I'll be improving on the blog gradually and making posts about it along the way.


## The plan
<ol>
    <li>Pick tools & hosting</li>
    <li>Blog website MVP - <em>probably just a page with text</em></li>
    <li>Publish website</li>
    <li>Add links to GitHub, Twitter, LinkedIn etc</li>
    <li>Improve appearance of the website</li>
    <li>A system that allows me to make and publish new blog posts directly on the website</li>
    <li>A comment section for blog posts</li>
    <li>Search Engine Optimizations (SEO)</li>
    <li>Allow people to subscribe to get notifications about new posts</li>
    <li>???</li>
</ol>

Let's see how far that plan takes us! 😄
