# [WIP] Making a blog with C# - Part 3 - Building the MVP

The first couple of blog posts are simply `.md` files stored in my project. 
In order to actually display them on the website the following actions had to be made:

- Find all `.md` files that should be displayed
- Read them
- Convert the text to HTML
- Render the HTML

## Rendering Markdown with Markdig

## Prettier Code Blocks

### Syntax Highlighting

## Publish through Visual Studio
